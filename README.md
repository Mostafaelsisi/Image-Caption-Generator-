# Image-Caption-Generator-
Image captioning is the task of generating textual descriptions of a given image, requiring techniques of computer vision and natural language processing.
It is a popular research area of Artificial Intelligence that deals with image understanding and a language description for that image. Generating well-formed sentences requires both syntactic and semantic understanding of the language. Being able to describe the content of an image using accurately formed sentences is a very challenging task, but it could also have a great impact, by helping visually impaired people better understand the content of images
